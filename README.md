### The Problem statement
["Women Safety Companion" aims to solve is the lack of immediate, reliable, and accessible assistance for women in distressful situations. Traditional safety methods such as manual calls or messaging may be ineffective during emergencies, especially when the person is unable to communicate. This project provides a solution by offering a real-time geolocation tracking system combined with a panic button,by sending email using formspree ensuring that help can be summoned instantly along with location details sent to trusted contacts.]
### The Solution
[We‚Äôre solving it by creating a super-smart, digital superhero‚ÄîThe Women Safety Companion! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è When a woman is in trouble, all she has to do is press the ‚ÄúHelp! I‚Äôm in Trouble‚Äù button, and boom!‚Äîinstant  alert sent to her trusted emails with her exact location, no need for any extra calls or messages. Powered by real-time geolocation magic, this app ensures that help is just a tap away, 24/7. Safety, simplicity, and speed‚Äîbecause every superhero deserves a sidekick! üí™üí•
