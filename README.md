### Project Description
Women Safety Companion is a web-based platform designed to provide safety features for women in distress. It includes real-time geolocation tracking and an emergency panic button that sends alerts with location information. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend with Node.js, it aims to offer immediate assistance in critical situations.

### The Problem Statement
Women in distress often face difficulties in quickly accessing help due to the inefficiency of traditional safety methods like manual calls or messaging. During emergencies, communication barriers can delay assistance. Our solution provides a real-time geolocation tracking system combined with a panic button that sends an alert via email (using Formspree) to predefined contacts, ensuring immediate action can be taken.

### The Solution
We‚Äôre solving it by creating a super-smart, digital superhero‚ÄîThe Women Safety Companion! üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è When a woman is in trouble, all she has to do is press the ‚ÄúHelp! I‚Äôm in Trouble‚Äù button, and **boom!**‚Äîan instant alert is sent to her trusted emails with her exact location. No need for any extra calls or messages! Powered by real-time geolocation magic, this app ensures that help is just a tap away, 24/7. **Safety, simplicity, and speed‚Äîbecause every superhero deserves a sidekick!** üí™üí•
